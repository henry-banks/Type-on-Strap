I am HENRY BANKS, a GAME DEVELOPER from in SEATTLE, WA.  
I am a gameplay programmer and game designer who has worked on everything from a
[clockpunk hack-and-slash](https://hbanks.itch.io/descent) to a [robot boxing game](https://hbanks.itch.io/junkbots) to a [physics-puzzle game about explosions](https://github.com/henry-banks/Explosive).

I am a long-time UNREAL ENGINE 4 developer, but lately I've been doing more and more stuff in UNITY.  
In many circles, I go by **MRSHMID** or **SHMIDDY** **MCSHMIDDINGTON**.  If you're not sure it's me, look for the weird Bionicle blade avatar.

If you like what you see and want me on your team, then you're in luck as I am **currently looking for jobs**.  
Send me an [EMAIL](mailto:hbanks410@gmail.com) or message me on [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/McShmiddington) or [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-banks/) for inquiries. (Or just to say hi!)
